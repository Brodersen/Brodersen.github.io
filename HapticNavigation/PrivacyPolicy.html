		<strong>Haptic Navigator Privacy Policy</strong>
		<p>
			The Haptic Navigator app (the iOS app for iPhone and associated Apple
			Watch Companion app) does not send any data to the developer or any third
			parties.
		</p>
		<p>
			The app only includes Apple provided frameworks and APIs. This is limited
			to calls to Apple Maps and geo-location services used only during the
			start of an activate navigation.
		</p>
		<p>
			Data stored on the users device is limited to finished navigation records
			and app settings. This data is stored locally on the device and can be
			viewed and deleted from the History and Settings screens respectively.
		</p>
		<p>
			If permitted by the user, the app can store finished navigations as
			Walking Workouts in the users Apple Fitness App. This can be disabled at
			any time in the app settings or by disallowing the app access to write to
			the users Health Data. The app is not able to read the users existing
			health data.
		</p>
		<p>
			Health and location data is private and personal. Haptic Navigator was
			made with respect to these values.
		</p>
		<p>This policy is effective as of 2021-08-15</p>

    <strong>WKHaptics Privacy Policy</strong> <p>
                  Gabriel Brodersen built the WKHaptics app as a standalone demo tool for WatchOS developers.
                </p> <p>
                  The only data that is collected in the app, is the users settings, which does not contain any person identifiable data. This data is saved on the device only, and can be deleted by resetting settings in the app or when the app is deleted. The app does not connect to the internet. The app does not involve any third parties. Although some types of haptics require the use of a background location session to be running — as required by Apple's WatchKit framework — data from this background location sessions is not used or processed in any way.
